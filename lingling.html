    <h1>Hello there fellow musician</h1>
        
    <h2>have you been practicing?</h2>
    
    <p>During quarantine theres a chance to learn a language, or more importantly become Ling Ling <br /> and <b> practice 40 hours a day </b> </p>
    <p> why 40 hours a day? well because <strong> LING LING ALREADY WON MENUIN COMPETITON. HOW ABOUT YOU LA??</strong>
    
    <hr />
    
    <p>I know what you may be wondering, <br /> <i> How can I practice forty hours a day when theres only 24? </i> </p>
    
        <h2>the answer is simple</h2>
        
        <p>first, practice your open strings for 5 hours so no left hand. <br /> but why not take advantage of that? </p>
        <p>Use your left hand for accuracy practice during the 5 hours of open string practice. 10 hours of practice in 5.</p>
        <p>during that time, use your mind to memorize new sheet music.</p>
        
        <p> <i> 15 hours of practice in 5 </i> </p>
        
        <p> Mental practice is extremly important. mental practice whenever you can.
             while doing open string practice, <br /> accuracy practice, and memorizing practice,
            also do mental practice to maximise efficiency. 20 hours of practice in 5. </p>
        
        <img src="doctor violinist.jpeg" alt="doctor violinist">
        
        <p> After 20 hours of practice, take a break. the goal is not to commit suicide. 
            eat some lunch and watch twoset, and type comment to keep your <br /> fingers
            warm. of course, mental practice during this time too. </p>
        
        <button onclick="window.location.href = 'https://www.youtube.com/user/twosetviolin';">Click here for TwoSet</button>
                        
        
        <p> afterwards is speed practice. your hands will be busy but your mind and eyes are not. take this chance to do more mental 
            practice and memorizing practice. do this for another 5 hours, fitting 15 hours into 5. </p>
        
        <hr />
        
        <h2> most importantly comes sleep. </h2>
        
        <p> without it, you'll tire yourself to death, wasting all that practice.</p>
        <p> during stage 1, 2, and REM sleep take these five hours as the opportunity to do more mental practice.</p>
        
        <p> and there you have it </p>
        
        <h1> 40 hours of practice a day </h1>
        
        <h3> and you still have 9 hours a day to do other things! <br />
            like medical school, sleep meals. </h3>
        
        <p> being a doctor and full time musician is not easy feat. </p>
        
        <p> Anyway, thanks for reading this guide on how to practice 40 hours a day!
            I hope it helped you with your practice goals. Keep practicing! </p>
